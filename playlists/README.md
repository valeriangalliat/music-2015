Playlists
=========

The `all-*.m3u` files contains the whole list of songs for each genre,
and the `build` script is able to generate them dynamically.

Other `*.m3u` files are personal playlists.

See the [`play`](../tools#play) tool to stream a playlist from YouTube
without downloading everything first.
